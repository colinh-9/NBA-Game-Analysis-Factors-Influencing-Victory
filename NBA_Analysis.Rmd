**Abstract**

This analysis investigates key factors contributing to winning in the NBA using data from the nba.sqlite database. The study employs various statistical techniques, including correlation analysis and visualization, to understand the impact of different performance metrics on game outcomes. Key areas of focus include free throw percentage (FT%), field goal percentage (FG%), three-point percentage (3P%), rebounds, and turnovers. 

The analysis begins with a setup to connect to the NBA SQLite database, extracting relevant game data for subsequent examination. It then explores the yearly correlation between FT% advantage and the margin of victory, providing insights into how FT% disparities between home and away teams influence game results.

Furthermore, the study extends to other metrics such as FG%, 3P%, and rebounding advantages, assessing their relationships with the margin of victory over different seasons. Visualizations using ggplot2 and ggcorrplot libraries aid in illustrating these relationships, highlighting trends and shifts in the strategic elements of NBA games over time.

The findings reveal significant trends in how these performance metrics correlate with winning, offering valuable insights for teams and analysts aiming to enhance their competitive strategies. The analysis underscores the evolving nature of NBA strategies and the increasing importance of certain metrics, such as three-point shooting, in modern basketball.

**Limitations**

It is important to acknowledge that the dataset has inherent limitations, including incomplete data for certain years and potential biases in data collection methods. Additionally, changes in game rules, such as the introduction of the three-point line in 1979, could influence the trends observed in the data.
